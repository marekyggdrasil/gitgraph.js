## Getting started

GitGraph.js codebase is a monorepo. Packages are released under `@gitgraph/*` scope.

As a user, you're probably interested in one of the rendering libraries:

- [gitgraph-js][gitgraph-js]
- [gitgraph-react][gitgraph-react]
- [gitgraph-node][gitgraph-node]

You'll find usage details in their README.

As a contributor, you might be interested in checking out [gitgraph-core][gitgraph-core]. It contains the core logic for rendering libraries to use.

## Running the project locally

Pre-requisites:

- [node.js][node]
- [yarn][yarn]

Setting things up:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:nicoespeon/gitgraph.js.git`
1.  Install dependencies: `yarn install`
1.  Bootstrap the project: `yarn run lerna bootstrap`

[Lerna][lerna] will install dependencies of all packages and links any cross-dependencies.

Available root-level commands are detailed in `package.json`. You would usually need:

- `yarn test` to run [Jest][jest] unit tests (`yarn test --watch` for watch mode)
- `yarn develop` to start [Storybook][storybook], watching for changes of all packages

> You can also go to specific packages and run available commands detailed in their `package.json`. For example, you could `cd packages/gitgraph-core/` and run `yarn test --watch` to only run tests of this package.
>
> But root-level commands are more convenient!
